## Our solution
The real estate market, despite its established status, faces a series of challenges that directly impact efficiency, transparency, and the costs of real estate transactions.

One of the most apparent problems is the lack of efficiency that permeates the entire process. The absence of innovation results in slow and bureaucratic processes, making access to properties more time-consuming and complex than it should be. Furthermore, the excessive presence of intermediaries in the transaction cycle exacerbates this scenario. The large number of agents involved makes the process even more complicated and costly, contributing to the lack of efficiency and the opacity that often surrounds transactions.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce Moken, an innovative solution that provides access to properties for a specified period, leveraging blockchain and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies. The approach is straightforward: property owners register their properties on the Moken platform and generate utility tokens. When users acquire these tokens, they gain access to the property for the specified time, and after that period, the token automatically expires.

Additionally, properties registered on the platform are equipped with an IoT system in the door lock that includes a microcontroller and an RFID reader. To access the property, users simply bring the Zeniq card close to the lock, ensuring easy entry, complete transparency, and maximum security.

Moken aims to revolutionize the real estate market by eliminating deeply-rooted inefficiencies, increasing transparency, and substantially reducing costs, offering a more efficient, cost-effective, and advantageous real estate experience for all parties involved. #YourTraverYourRules
